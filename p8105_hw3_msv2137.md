The dataset `instacart` records online grocery orders from Instacart
users. It contains 1384617 observations from 131209 unique users. The
dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Some key variables are as
follows:

-   order\_id: order identifier
-   product\_id: product identifier
-   reordered: coded as 1 if this product has been ordered by the user
    in the past, 0 if otherwise
-   product\_name: name of the product
-   order\_number: the order sequence number for a user (1 = first, n =
    nth)
-   days\_since\_prior\_order: days since the last order, but capped at
    30 days (NA of order\_number = 1)

Let’s take a look at a single row of data. In order 1, user 112108
ordered Bulgarian Yogurt (product id = 49302). The product is from the
dairy eggs department, and was in the yogurt aisle. It was the 1st
product they added to their cart. This user has placed an order 4 times
before, and this product has been previously ordered by them (reordered
= 1). The order was placed on a Thursday (order\_dow = 4), in the 10th
hour of the day (10am), and 9 days since the user last placed an
Instacart order.

### Aisles

``` r
aisle_number = instacart %>% 
  distinct(aisle) %>% 
  nrow()
```

There are 134 aisles.

``` r
most_items_aisle = instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(3)
```

    ## Selecting by n

The fresh vegetables aisle, is where the most items have been ordered
from. The fresh fruits aisle, is where the second most items have been
ordered from. The packaged vegetables fruits aisle, is where the third
most items have been ordered from.

### Aisles Plot

``` r
aisle_plot = instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle", x = "Aisle", y = "Number of Items") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = rel(1), hjust = 1))

    count = n()) %>%
  top_n(3, count) %>%

### Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream Table

``` r
days_of_week = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")

mean_hour_order = instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%

  mutate(order_dow = days_of_week[order_dow + 1]) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour

# Problem 2

## Load Data

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")

#View(brfss_smart2010)
```

## Data Cleaning

``` r
brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")))

#View(brfss_data)
```

## 7 or more loactions

``` r
states_2002 = brfss_data %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc) %>%
  summarize(num_loc = n()) %>%
  filter(num_loc > 6) %>%
  pull(locationabbr)

states_2010 = brfss_data %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc) %>%
  summarize(num_loc = n()) %>%
  filter(num_loc > 6) %>%
  pull(locationabbr)
```

The states: CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA were observed at 7 or more locations
in 2002. The states: CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX,
WA were observed at 7 or more locations in 2010.

## Excellent Dataset & Plot

``` r
#construct the dataset
excellent_data = brfss_data %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  select(year, locationabbr, data_value) %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  summarise(mean_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = T))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
#construct the spaghetti plot
excellent_plot = excellent_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_value, color = locationabbr)) + geom_line(alpha = .5, ) + labs(title = "Average Value Over Time Within a State", y = "Average Value Within a State", color = "States")

  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>%
  filter(year == 2006 | year == 2010) %>%
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, data_value, response) %>%
  group_by(response) 

#make plot

# Problem 3

## Load, Tidy and Wrangle Data

``` r
#accel_data = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv")
#View(accel_data)

accel_data = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    weekday = ifelse(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"),
    minute = as.numeric(minute)
  )
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443

## Description

In the accelometer dataset, there are 50400 rows and 6 columns. Some
variables that exist are the week number (week), the day id (day\_id),
the day of the week (day), the minute of the day (minute), the activity
levels recorded in each minute of the day (activity\_count), and a
variable that distiguishes weekdays from weekends (weekday).

## Table of Total Activity Per Day

``` r
accel_data %>%
  mutate(day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))) %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(
    total_activity = sum(activity_count)
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = total_activity
    ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
|-----:|----------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|
|    1 |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |   376254 | 631105 |
|    2 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |   607175 | 422018 |
|    3 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |   382928 | 467052 |
|    4 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |     1440 | 260617 |
|    5 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |     1440 | 138421 |

### Trends?

To investigate trends let’s group activity level by day of the week

``` r
level_by_day = accel_data %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count))

knitr::kable(level_by_day)
```

| day       | total\_activity |
|:----------|----------------:|
| Friday    |         2291711 |
| Monday    |         1858699 |
| Saturday  |         1369237 |
| Sunday    |         1919213 |
| Thursday  |         2091151 |
| Tuesday   |         1799238 |
| Wednesday |         2129772 |

We can also group activity level by week

``` r
level_by_week = accel_data %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count))

knitr::kable(level_by_week)
```

| week | total\_activity |
|-----:|----------------:|
|    1 |         2569863 |
|    2 |         3231718 |
|    3 |         3224916 |
|    4 |         1919875 |
|    5 |         2512649 |

From our investigation, we can see that activity levels are highest on
Fridays and Wednesdays, and lowest on Saturdays and Tuesdays. In our
second table, we also see that activity levels were the highest in Week
2 and lowest in Week 4.

## Plot 24 Hr Activity for Each Day

``` r
accel_data %>%
  mutate(day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Activity Over the Course of the Day",
    x = "Minute",
    y = "Activity"
  )
```

### Analysis

Several observations can be made from this graph. On all days of the
week, activity in lower during the first \~300 minutes of the day, as
well as the last \~150 minutes of the day. A possible explanation for
this is that the patient may be sleeping during these times.

On certain days, the patient has different spikes in activity. On
Friday, the patient’s activity is higher in the night and it runs longer
into the night than on other days. On Sundays, the patient’s peak
activity occurs around minute 850 approximately. On Thursdays, there is
a spike in activity around minute 350 approximately.
